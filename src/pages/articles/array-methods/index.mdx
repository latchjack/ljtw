When you’re writing code, one of the most common things you'll come across is an array. If you don't know or aren't sure what an array is, this first section is for you. If you do, feel free to jump to the next section.

## What is an array?

Arrays are a fundamental part of (mostly) every programming language.
Arrays are a great way to store a collection of data and come with many handy methods built in.

A great way that I was taught about arrays was to think of them like a shopping list.

```js
let shoppingList = ['eggs', 'milk', 'bread']
```

Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the first index (item in the array) is 0.
For example in the `animals` array below, `dog` is at index 0 and `cat` is at index 1.
Whilst the indexes of 'dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'tiger' are 0, 1, 2 and 3, the array still has a length of 4. Which we could confirm by writing `animals.length`.

```js
let animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'tiger']

console.log(animals[0]) // 'dog'
console.log(animals[1]) // 'cat'
console.log(animals.length) // result will be 4
```

Often arrays will be used to store data in objects, so that they can be used store more information. Like below...

```js
let animals = [
  {
    id: 1,
    animal: 'dog',
    noise: 'woof',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    animal: 'cat',
    noise: 'meow',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    animal: 'bird',
    noise: 'tweet',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    animal: 'tiger',
    noise: 'roar',
  },
]
```

## Array methods

Arrays have many powerful methods built into them which can help you do lots of cool things when you're building applications.

### toString

The toString method is used to transform an array into a string. So our shopping list from earlier would become...

```js
let shoppingList = ['eggs', 'milk', 'bread']

let shoppingAsString = shoppingList.toString()
console.log(shoppingAsString) // result would be 'eggs, milk, bread'
```

### map

The map method creates a new array that will be filled with the results of the function you give it.
In the example below, I use the map method to create an array full of the integers array numbers multiplied by 2.

```js
let integers = [2, 4, 6, 8]

let doubleIt = integers.map((number) => number * 2)
console.log(doubleIt) // result would be [4, 8, 12, 16]
```

### flat

The flat method creates a new array which has been 'flattened'. This method is meant to be used on an array with sub-arrays. It will then return it as one single array or as a specified depth.

For example...

```js
let subArrays = [[2], [4], [6], [8]]

let flattenIt = subArrays.flat()
console.log(flattenIt) // result would be [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

These are just a few of the numerous array methods that you may come across in your programming journey.

Some of the ones I use frequently are...

1. includes()
2. filter()
3. push()
4. forEach()
5. concat()

This is the first programming blog post I've ever written. I'd love to improve, so if you have any tips or critiques, I'd love to hear it.

Thanks for reading!
